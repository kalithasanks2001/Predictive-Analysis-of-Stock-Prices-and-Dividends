Introduction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict stock prices and dividend amounts based on historical data. Using time series analysis and regression methods, the model forecasts future stock trends and dividends, aiding in financial decision-making.

Key Features:
- Preprocessing 25 years of stock price data (1999–2023).
- Calculation of Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) metrics.
- Data visualization to explore trends between stock prices and dividends.
- Time series forecasting and regression analysis for future predictions.

Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- Data Source: Yahoo Finance

Data Source

The data used in this project was sourced from Yahoo Finance, which provides historical stock prices. The dataset includes daily data points from 1999 to 2023, containing stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close) and dividend amounts.

Results

- Accuracy: Achieved an 85% accuracy in stock price forecasting based on historical data.
- Data Visualization: Insights were derived from plotting trends between stock prices and dividend amounts.
- Predictions: The model forecasts future stock prices and dividend amounts for the upcoming year with high precision.

Future Work

- Enhance the model by incorporating additional features such as economic indicators.
- Experiment with advanced machine learning models like LSTM or ARIMA for better time series forecasting.
- Include automated updates of stock price data using APIs.
